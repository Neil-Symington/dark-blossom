# dark-blossom
 A reopsitory for learning generative art. Inspired by Alex Bainter's (https://alexbainter.com/) blossom. The sounds hear were recorded by me in reaper and sampled from my track streets (https://soundcloud.com/neil_symington/streets). My aim is to build on this efort and make it darker and more complex.
